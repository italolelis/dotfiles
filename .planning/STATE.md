## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: GNU Stow 2.x required (2.4.0 specifically — fixes --dotfiles flag with directories)
- [Init]: antidote chosen over zinit (pure zsh, no binary dep, works in containers without Rust)
- [Init]: Starship replaces Powerlevel10k (P10k on maintenance-only as of June 2025)
- [Init]: Symlinks over rsync — edits in $HOME flow back to repo automatically

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Cursor devcontainer + symlinked install.sh behavior is LOW confidence. Test empirically before Phase 3 planning — install.sh may need to be a real file, not a symlink.
- [Phase 1]: Audit every config file for secrets BEFORE any git add. Run gitleaks detect before first push.
- [Phase 1]: Never use stow --adopt as first migration step — it silently overwrites repo files with machine state.
